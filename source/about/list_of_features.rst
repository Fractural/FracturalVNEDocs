Vulkan renderer.

- HDR rendering with sRGB.
- Perspective, orthographic and frustum-offset cameras.

**Physically-based rendering:**

- Follows the Disney PBR model.
- Uses a roughness-metallic workflow with support for ORM textures.
- Normal mapping.
- Parallax/relief mapping with automatic level of detail based on distance.
- Sub-surface scattering and transmittance.
- Proximity fade (soft particles) and distance fade.
- Distance fade can use alpha blending or dithering to avoid going through
  the transparent pipeline.
- Dithering can be determined on a per-pixel or per-object basis.

**Real-time lighting:**

- Directional lights (sun/moon). Up to 4 per scene.
- Omnidirectional lights.
- Spot lights with adjustable cone angle and attenuation.
- Adjustable light "size" for fake area lights (will also make shadows blurrier).
- Lights are rendered with clustered forward optimizations to decrease their
  individual cost.

**Shadow mapping:**

- *DirectionalLight:* Orthogonal (fastest), PSSM 2-split and 4-split.
  Supports blending between splits.
- *OmniLight:* Dual paraboloid (fast) or cubemap (slower but more accurate).
  Supports colored projector textures in the form of panoramas.
- *SpotLight:* Single texture. Supports colored projector textures.

  the shadow is casted on.
- Adjustable blur on a per-light basis.

**Global illumination with indirect lighting:**

- Baked lightmaps (fast, but can't be updated at run-time).

   - Lightmaps are baked on the GPU using compute shaders.

- GI probes (slower, fully real-time). Supports reflections.
- Signed distance field GI (intermediate, supports dynamic lights but not
  dynamic occluders). Supports reflections.
- Global illumination uses a deferred pass to allow for adaptive subsampling.

**Fog:**

- Depth fog (exponential or with custom attenuation).
- Height fog (floor or ceiling) with adjustable attenuation.
- Support for automatic depth fog color depending on the camera direction
  (to match the sun color).
- Optional transmittance to make lights more visible in the fog.

**Particles:**

- GPU-based particles with support for custom particle shaders.
- CPU-based particles.

**Post-processing:**

- Tonemapping (Linear, Reinhard, Filmic, ACES).
- Automatic exposure adjustments based on viewport brightness.
- Near and far depth of field with adjustable bokeh simulation.
- Screen-space ambient occlusion at half or full resolution.
- Glow/bloom with optional bicubic upscaling and several blend modes available:
  Screen, Soft Light, Add, Replace, Mix.
- Color correction using an one-dimensional ramp.
- Roughness limiter to reduce the impact of specular aliasing.
- Brightness, contrast and saturation adjustments.

**Texture filtering:**

- Nearest, bilinear, trilinear or anisotropic filtering.
- Filtering options are defined on a per-use basis, not a per-texture basis.

**Texture compression:**

- Basis Universal (slow, but results in smaller files).
- BPTC for high-quality compression (not supported on macOS).
- ETC2 (not supported on macOS).
- S3TC (not supported on mobile/Web platforms).

**Anti-aliasing:**

- Fast approximate antialiasing (FXAA).

Most of these effects can be adjusted for better performance or to further
improve quality. This can be helpful when using Godot for offline rendering.

- Read and write INI-style configuration files using :ref:`class_ConfigFile`.

   - Can (de)serialize any Godot datatype, including Vector, Color, ...

   - Can be :ref:`compiled <doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem>` using GCC,
     Clang and MSVC. MinGW is also supported.
   - Friendly towards packagers. In most cases, system libraries can be used
     instead of the ones provided by Godot. The build system doesn't download anything.
     Builds can be fully reproducible.

- Licensed under the permissive MIT license.
