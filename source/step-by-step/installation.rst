Installation
============

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Fractural/FracturalVisualNovelEngine/releases) of the github repository for Fractural VNE.

2. Find the latest release (Should be the top most release).

3. Download one of the two .zip files:
   - If you want C# support, then download "MonoFracturalVNE.zip"
   - If you just need GDScript support, then download "FracturalVNE.zip"

.. note:: tThe _modules folder actually contains optional folders that can be deleted at will to customize the plugin to your needs. 

4. Create a new Godot project or open an existing one.

5. Create a "res://addons" folder if it does not already exist.

6. Unzip the downloaded zip file as a folder into "res://addons". This should leave you with a "res://addons/FracturalVNE" folder containing the plugin.

7. If you downloaded the Mono version of the plugin, make sure to rebuild the solution, which can be done by pressing the build button on the top left of the editor.
